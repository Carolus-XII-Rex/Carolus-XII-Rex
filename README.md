### Hi, I'm Nikita! ðŸ‘‹

I am currently working as a Data Scientist at Sberbank, contributing to the Internal Audit Service with the use of my Python skills.  

Being passionate about all the topics of Data Science I am always looking for new opportunities to learn and develop various techniques. 
Right now I am focused on Big Data technologies (Spark, Dask).

I have gained a lot of experience through taking part in audit procedures implementing different Data Mining algorithms, NLP models and others.  

The culture and ethics of working with data is amongst the things I have learned as a member of audit teams so I usually do not use public repositories. 
However I managed to pick a few projects for demonstration purposes and I am thrilled to show them to you.  

Feel free to contact me at [nik.kiriushkin@gmail.com](mailto:nik.kiriushkin@gmail.com)  
and have a nice day!


P.S.  
Just one more thing :wink:    

> You know, sir, it's a funny thing. All my life I kept running into smart people. I don't just mean smart like you and the people in this house. You know what I mean. In school, there were lots of smarter kids. And when I first joined the force, sir, they had some very clever people there. And I could tell right away that it wasn't gonna be easy making detective as long as they were around. But I figured, if I worked harder than they did, put in more time, read the books, kept my eyes open, maybe I could make it happen. And I did. And I really love my work, sir.
