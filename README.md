### Hi, I'm Nikita! ðŸ‘‹

I am currently working as a Data Scientist at Sberbank, contributing to the Internal Audit Service with the use of my Python skills.  

Being passionate about all the topics of Data Science I am always looking for new opportunities to learn and develop various techniques. 
Right now I am focused on Big Data technologies (Spark, Dask).

I have gained a lot of experience through taking part in audit procedures implementing different Data Mining algorithms, NLP models and others.  

The culture and ethics of working with data is amongst the things I have learned as a member of audit teams so I usually do not use public repositories. 
However I managed to pick a few projects for demonstration purposes and I am thrilled to show them to you.  

Feel free to contact me at [nik.kiriushkin@gmail.com](nik.kiriushkin@gmail.com)  
and have a nice day!
